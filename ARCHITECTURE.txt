How to talk about the app
- Purpose: A coffee shop mobile app to browse products, search/filter, favorite, add to cart, and view details.
- Flow: Welcome → Login → Tabbed experience (Home, Favorites, Cart, Profile); product detail available from lists.
- Data: Mock products/categories in-code; no backend yet; prices and descriptions seeded for demo.
- State: Cart/favorites/category via React Context; persisted auth via Zustand + AsyncStorage; hydration guard to avoid flicker.
- Navigation: React Navigation stack + bottom tabs; typed with TypeScript route params.
- UX: Home has category chips and search-as-you-type filter with empty state; featured + grid offers; favorites and cart show derived data; profile handles logout.
- Persistence: AsyncStorage for favorites/cart and login flag; cart math utilities for subtotal/total with discount example.
- Tech: React Native 0.82, React 19, TypeScript, Bootsplash for splash, AsyncStorage for persistence.
